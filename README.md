# Blood Witch

_Blood Witches were the first mortal servants of the Demon Lord Rakdos to receive his unholy gifts. Those that are able to entertain him and pass his trials are able to power their magic by sacrificing their lifeblood to the Lord of Debauchery. While most in his favor give themselves to become fiend princes, the most ambitious of his followers strive for the power of a blood witch._

### Blood Casting

An event in your life, or in that of your ancestors, has tied your life force to the weave. This connection, whatever its source, fuels your spells.

#### Cantrips

At 1st level, you know four cantrips of your choice from the Blood Witch spell list. You learn additional Blood Witch cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Blood Witch table.

#### Spell Level

The Blood Witch table shows the maximum level at which you can cast spells. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a number of hit points equal to the spell's level multiplied by the HP Cost per Spell Level in the Blood Witch table. You cannot expend temporary hit points to cast spells in this way. If you gain spell slots from another source, you can use these spell slots to cast Blood Witch spells without expending hit points. Alternatively, you can cast spells normally requiring spell slots by expending the corresponding amount of hit points. You can only cast spells by expending hit points up to the maximum level spell you could cast as a Blood Witch.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher

You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the Blood Witch spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Blood Witch table shows when you learn more Blood Witch spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level less than or equal to the Max Spell Level column of the Blood Witch table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the Blood Witch spells you know and replace it with another spell from the Blood Witch list.

#### Spellcasting Ability

Constitution is your spellcasting ability for your Blood Witch spells, since the power of your magic relies on your ability to channel your life force into the world. You use your Constitution whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Constitution modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Blood Witch spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell Save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

**Spell Attack Modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier

#### Spellcasting Focus

You can use any weapon you are proficient with that deals piercing or slashing damage as your spellcasting focus for your Blood Witch spells.

### Bloodline

Choose a bloodline, which describes the source of your innate magical power: Inheritor, Demon Blessed, or Cursebound.

Your choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and again at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.

### Blood Pool

At 2nd level, you learn how to exert more of your will into your magic by sacrificing some of your future vitality. This is represented by your Blood Pool, which allows you to strengthen the spells you cast.

#### Blood Dice

At the end of each long rest, you can expend a number of available Hit Dice to add that many Blood Dice to your Blood Pool. Before allocating Blood Dice, any unexpended Blood Dice from the previous rest are turned back into available Hit Dice.

Whenever you expend 1 or more Blood Dice, all healing you receive is halved for 1 minute, as you siphon off your future vitality for momentary power.

At 2nd level, your Blood Dice are d4s. This increases to d6s at 10th level and d8s at 17th level.

#### Pooled Casting

When casting a spell by expending hit points, you can expend any number of Blood Dice from your Blood Pool. Roll these dice and reduce the hit point cost of the spell by the result.

### Empowered Blood Casting

At 3rd level, you gain the ability to strengthen you spells using your Blood Dice. You gain two of the following Empowerment options of your choice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.

You can use only one Empowerment option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

#### Bloody Precision

When you cast a spell that requires a spell attack roll, you can expend one of your Blood Dice and add it to the roll before it is declared whether the attack hits.

#### Bloody Reach

When you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can expend any number of Blood Dice to extend the range by twice the result.

When you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend any number of Blood Dice to make the range of the spell a number of feet equal to twice the result.

#### Bloody Strength

When you roll for damage for a spell, you can expend one of your Blood Dice to increase the damage by the result.

You can use Bloody Strenght even if you have already used a different Empowerment option during the casting of the spell.

#### Bloody Knowledge

When you cast a spell with a range of self, you can expend two of your Blood dice to make the range of the spell touch.

#### Bloody Healing

When you cast a spell that would restore health or grant temporary hit points, you can expend one of your Blood Dice and increase the health granted by the result. This spell overcomes a Blood Witch's penalty to healing from expending Blood Dice.

#### Bloody Corruption

When you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw to resist its effects, you can spend one of your Blood Dice to decrease the saving throw of one target by half the result (rounded up).

### Ability Score Improvement

When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you canâ€™t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking this feature to take a feat of your choice instead.

### Blood Lord

At 20th level, you have mastered the art of manipulating magic with your blood. When you engage in Empowered Blood Casting, you may apply any number of the Empowerment options you know as long as they could normally be applied to that spell. Each Empowerment option can only be applied to a single spell once.

Additionally, you no longer suffer a healing penalty when you expend your Blood Dice.

## Bloodlines

Different blood witches claim different origins for their innate magic. Almost all Blood Witches can trace these origins to one of three options: Inheritor, Demon Blessed, or Cursebound.
